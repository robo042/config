# config file examples

A collection of example config files you can use to customize your Ubuntu terminal experience.

---

For the following files:
- bash_aliases
- bash_functions
- bashrc
- vimrc

You would stage them in your home directory as hidden files like
    `~/.bash_aliases`

---

For the two scripts:
  - setup_git_keys.sh
  - custom_ubuntu_terminal_profile.sh

You would simply need to execute each one once.\
`setup_kit_keys.sh` will generate an ssh key (if necessary) 
and then spit out a github link where you can add it.\
`custom_ubuntu_terminal_profile.sh` creates a custom Ubuntu Terminal profile
named "Custom" with custom colors and settings, etc.
